The main functionality and the logic of the game was done by Robert Mirzoyan. For example things like the logic of snake, how the snake grows or eats food, the logic of food and how it is generated, the varieties of food and their functionality and what the do to the snake, logic of the game, and much more. Haynrikh Santrosyan worked mostly on the GUI part of the project creating the board screen on which the snake must move and interact with other stuff also worked on , picking a color for snake, the overall movement of the snake adding the key bindings to the game (pressing key on keyboard to move).Also Robert and I worked on optimizing the game as much as possible and making it better coded.

Thank You.
