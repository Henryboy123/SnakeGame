# SnakeGame
 A basic snake game made with java.


 Update No#2 
In this update we added more functionality to the game. The snake now is capable of moving growing properly and changing directions. To an extant the core part of the game is already finished. The things left to do are as follows. A menu bar containing of buttons. The buttons for example will give the player the option to start, pause and end the game, show the current score (Number of food points eaten) and many more GUI changes making the game more user friendly.

The main functionality and the logic of the game was done by Robert Mirzoyan. For example things like the logic of snake, logic of the game, how the snake grows or eats food, the logic of food and how it is generated and much more. Also Robert worked on Optimizing the game as much as possible and making it better coded. Haynrikh Santrosyan worked mostly on the GUI part of the project creating the board on which the snake must move and introducing the overall movement of the snake adding the key bindings to the game so that the snake moves not with the code but on user input (pressing key on keyboard).


Further Plans
Try to find and fix bugs in the game. Make a better GUI and add more functionality to the game. Try to optimise and lastly make a small presentation consisting of slides that will properly introduce our classmates what the game is how it operates and how the code is handled.

Thank You.
